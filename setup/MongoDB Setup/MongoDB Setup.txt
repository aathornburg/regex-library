Steps in order to setup MongoDB:

1. Install MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center
2. Then create C:\devl\data\db and {MongoDB Install}\log\mongod.log
    -To create mongod.log, navigate to the {MongoDB Install}\log directory and execute 'echo "" > mongod.log' to create a blank mongod.log file.
3. Open a command prompt in administrative mode
4. Run the command
    mongod.exe --config "C:\devl\software\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\etc\mongod.conf" --install

    -This should install mongodb as a Windows service and force it to start automatically.
    -Notes:
        -Ensure that the User group has FULL ACCESS to the C:\devl\data\db\" directory.  This may cause issues otherwise.
        -The .conf file will be available on GitHub at https://github.com/aathornburg/regex-library
